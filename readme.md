# Spotify RecSys Challenge 2018
***hello world!*** Team: Hojin Yang, Minjin Choi, and Yoon Ki Jeong.  
Data Mining Lab, Sungkyunkwan university.   

## This document is still incomplete and will be updated soon.  


This project is an automatic playlist continuation(APC) system implemented using Tensorflow.  
The main algorithm we use is Denoising Autoencoders which reconstructs original playlists from an input of corrupted ones. 
In additon, we apply Character-level convolutional networks to playlist-title based music recommendation.  


The charateristics of our model are as follows: 
* Unlike pure collaborate filtering model which only extend playlists not profiled at training time, our system generates a list of recommended tracks to a new playlist(not in the training set).

* Not only tracks but also artists are used to construct latent representation of playlists. This allows robust recommendation for a playlist of songs occur in very few playlists.

## Development Environment
* Python Anaconda v4.4.10  
* Tensorflow v1.5.0  
* CUDA Toolkit v9.0 and cuDNN v7.0  
* GPU: 4 Nvidia GTX 1080Ti  

## Dataset
Spotify has produced the MPD(Million Playlist Dataset) which contains a million user-curated playlists. Each playlist in the MPD contains a playlist title, a list of tracks(with metadata), and other miscellaneous information. 

## Preprocess The Data
Proceed with these steps to convert the MPD’s data format into our system's.
1. Download Spotify's MPD tar file which contains a thousand MPD-slice json files(each contains a thounsand playlists).
2. Divide json files into two groups: training folder and test folder. And place each data folders into the root folder of the project.
3. You can get resturcturedd data by running **data_generator.py**.  
*Arguments of data_generator.py*   
`--datadir`		: Directory where converted dataset(training, test, challenge) will be stored. *default: ./data*  
`--mpd_tr`		: Directory which contains MPD-slice json files used for training the model. *default: ./mpd_train*  
`--mpd_te`		: Directory which contains MPD-slice json files used for testing the model. *default: ./mpd_test*     
`--mpd_ch`		: Directory which contains the challenge set json file. *default: ./challenge*   
`--mincount_trk`	: The minimum number of occurences of tracks in the train data *default: 5*  
`--mincount_art`	: The minimum number of occurences of artists in the train data *default: 3*  
`--divide_ch`		: A list where each elements is a range of challenge seed numbers *default: 0-1,5,10-25,10-25r* 	    
For example, you can set the dicrectories as the following command : 
```console  
python data_generator.py --datadir ./data --mpd_tr ./mpd_train --mpd_te ./mpd_test --mpd_ch ./challenge
```
If you want set manually the minimum number of occurences of tracks and artists on training set. 
When you run the following command, tracks with less than three occurrences are removed:
```console
python data_generator.py --mincount_trk 3 
```
4. scripts above populate the ‘./data’ with one training json file, multiple types of test json, and challenge json.  

    
Each test files contains same seed pattern as Spotify RecSys Challenge: seed 0, 1, 5, 10, 25, 100, 25r, 100r.  
We also divide challenge set into four subsets based on seed pattern: (0,1) , (5) , (10,25,100) , (25r,100r)  
 
For submission, we train our models with four different denoising schemes to train our model in three versions.
Each version performs better on one of four different challenge subsets.  


## Run The System
Our model is composed of two parts: Denoising Autoencoders and Character-level CNN; train the parameters of the DAE first, then integrate with char-level CNN.
1. Create a folder into the root folder of the project. *config.ini* file, which contains information required to run the model, 
must be placed into the created folder(Check the structure of *conf.ini* below).  
2. You can train models by running **main.py**.  
*Arguments of data_generator.py*   
`--dir`			: Directory name which contains config file  
`--pretrain`	: Pretrain dae parameters if specified  
`--dae`			: Train dae parameteres if specified  
`--title`		: Train paramters of title module if specified  
`--challenge`	: Generate challenge submission candidates if specified  
`--testmode`	: Get the results without training the model   
Suppose the folder you create at step above is './sample'.   
we recommand you to **pretrain the DAE with tied condition**; constrain decoder’s weights to be equal to transposed encoder’s.
Using those weights as initial values of DAE brings much better results than not pretraining the weights.   
First, run main in pretrain mode(tied DAE):  
```console
python main.py --dir sample --pretrain
```
Run main in DAE mode after the loss is converged in pretrain mode.
If you set pretrain file name in config.ini file, following command will use pretrained paramters saved in the fold you created(./sample). 
You can also train DAE without initital value depending on the *config.ini *setting:  
```console
python main.py --dir sample --dae
```
After you run DAE, its parameters are saved as pickle format in ./sample.   

3. You can train char-CNN if DAE’s parameters is save in the folder you created is saved in the fold you created. After you run the command below, the final tensor graph will be generated:
```console
python main.py --dir sample --title
```
4. Finally you can generate challenge submission candidates by using graph you get at the step above:  
```console
python main.py --dir sample --challenge
```
**[note]**  
For all models, paramters are updated if the models' r-precision value increases. Our system calculates r-precision score every epoch.  
You must specify only one mode(dae, title, challenge) when you set argument of *main.py*.  
You can easily replace parameter pickle files(for DAE) and ckpt graph file(for title) with other paramters with same data format and shape. 
If you want to check metrices score after replacing paramters with another one with the same shape, using *--testmode* is efficient:
```console
# after replacing DAE pickle file from another folder #
python main.py --dir sample --dae --testmode
```

## Build Our Submission    
We already set the initial setting: create 4 different directory(0to1_inorder,5_inorder,10to100_inorder, 25to100_random), 
and set config file of each directory.  
1. Divide 1,000 mpd.slice.###.json files into two directories(train, test). We use 997 slices for training 
except *'mpd.slice.250000-250999', 'mpd.slice.500000-500999', 'mpd.slice.750000-750999'* which are used for testing the model.  
The directory containing challenge_set.json is also needed for generating challenge data following our format.  
2. Run **data_generator.py** with default arguments(or change if you want). 
Then './data' is created which contains training data and test data with multiple categories as json format. 
Challenge data with four different categories are also created as we set `--divide_ch` of **data_generator** as *0-1,5,10-25,10-25r(andom)*.  
Dividing challenge data into four subset means we use four different schemes to train our model and ensemble the results at the last moment.  
3. We already set four different directories which contain config.ini optimized for each challenge categories. 
The approximante information is as follows:  

| directory | challenge category | firstN | input denoising | pretrain only	|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0to1_inorder | challenge_inorder_0to1 | 0, 0.3 | 0.75 | True |
| 5_inorder | challenge_inorder_5 | 1, 50 | 0.75 | False |
| 10to100_inorder | challenge_inorder_10to100 | 0.3, 0.6 | 0.75 | False |
| 25to100_random | challenge_random_25to100 | -1 | 0.5, 0.8 | False |  

4. Run pretrain mode for each directories. Then run dae mode except 0to1_inorder  
5. For title mode, it is more efficient to run just one directory(0to1_inorder) 
and copy the thensor graph outputs(generated after running on title mode) to others.  
You don't have to train in title mode for all directories, as outputs are same.  
6. Run challenge mode for each directories.  
7. Run ***merge_results.py*** to merge results from different directories and generate .csv files.
